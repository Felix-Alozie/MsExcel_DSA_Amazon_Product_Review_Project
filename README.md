# ðŸ›’ Amazon Product Review Analysis

## Project Overview

This project explores and analyzes product and customer review data from Amazon to uncover actionable insights for product optimization, marketing strategy, and customer engagement. Conducted as part of the Data Science Accelerator (DSA) final project, the analysis simulates the responsibilities of a Junior Data Analyst at **RetailTech Insights**, an e-commerce analytics company serving sellers on platforms like Amazon.

Through Excel-based data analysis techniquesâ€”including pivot tables, calculated fields, and data visualizationâ€”the project answers strategic questions on pricing, discount behavior, customer ratings, and revenue opportunities.

1. The Electronics category dominates in revenue generation with over â‚¦88,021 million, followed by Computers & Accessories and Health & Personal Care. These categories should be prioritized for inventory optimization, cross-promotions, and strategic advertising. Sales teams can target upselling and bundling strategies around these top-performing categories to maximize revenue.
2. The overall average product rating is above 4.1, indicating strong customer satisfaction. However, most ratings cluster between 3.8 and 4.6, suggesting there's room to improve product quality and customer experience, especially for items rated below 3.5. Marketing and support teams should investigate low-rated items to resolve product flaws or clarify product descriptions.
3. There are 653 products with discounts of 50% or more, yet a noticeable decline in product ratings at these high-discount points suggests that steep discounts may not always correlate with customer satisfaction. Management should evaluate whether excessive price cuts are compromising product perception, and implement smarter markdowns tied to quality assurance.
4. With over 1,465 unique products, the catalog shows impressive breadth. However, a significant 301 products have fewer than 1,000 reviews, which may point to underperforming listings or limited visibility. These items could benefit from targeted campaigns, influencer reviews, or enhanced product descriptions to boost engagement and conversions.
5. The dashboard reveals a â‚¹200â€“â‚¹500 price range contains the majority of product listings, and many top-reviewed products fall within this mid-range bracket. Focusing on this pricing tier can offer a sweet spot for profitability and customer acquisition. The top 5 rated and reviewed products also serve as models for replicating success. The teams should study their positioning, presentation, and fulfillment practices.
